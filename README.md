# Machine Learning Pipeline

Welcome to this project.

In this project I would like to show my skills using machine learning tools for develop a pipeline for an end-to-end data science project.

your shiny new codespace! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Python and Jupyter notebooks.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

From here I started to personalize my Notebook in order to show my skills in Data Analytics, Data Science and Machine Learning.
